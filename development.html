            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This was a chance to develop an interactive interface, use interface components, and tie the components to an internal data state. I was able to get comfortable with React by creating a list-based interface! Basically, I created an interface for users to select items out of a list, which then aggregates them.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p class="blurb">
          The goal of this application is to understand React and the behind-the-scenes components of interactive interfaces. The goal of this particular application is to provide users with a list of suggested movies. The audience is those wanting movie recommendations. The user can sort the suggested movies from highest to lowest rated. They can filter the movies based on genre and rating. The user can also add a movie to their Watchlist (aggregation) where the total number of watching time will be displayed along with their selected movies.   
        </p>
        <h2>Design Interations</h2>
        <p class="blurb"> 
          Usability is considered in understanding how the user will go about optimizing the interface. Thus, all the filters/sorting/aggregation are located in one section of the site. The items are also organized in order for the user to see as much information without being overwhelmed. Different-sized headings give the user an understanding of the hierarchy.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="blurb">
            This project made me take everything I've learned about a user and apply it from the ground up. Every design decision had to have the user in mind. 
            One takeaway is how useful libraries like React can be in creating a successful interface.
