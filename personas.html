            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This project allowed me to understand the user. I observed and recorded how users interacted with the elevator at the John Hay Library. Interviews were conducted and personas were made. This project was meant to help me understand how to design something with the user in mind.

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p class="blurb">
        First, I studied how the elevator buttons worked. This helped me gain an understanding of how a user would interact with the interface. Personas are already a well-known UI/UX tool. By fitting my recorded observations into these personas, I was able to get to know who is using this particular elevator and how they interact with it.
       <br><br>
        I've included my observations below: 
      </p>
      <p class="blurb">
        - Swipe access takes time to register, not always successful.<br>
- Traffic from both patrons and employees.<br>
- Take's Arrington a long time to locate 3rd floor.<br>
- Worker clicks wrong floor by mistake. They are similar.<br>

      <h2>Design Interations</h2>
      <p class="blurb">
        In designing my experiment, I had to think about all types of users. This helped me shape my questions. I aimed to be as impartial as possible. I tried not to suggest issues 
        but to really let the user's thoughts drive my findings. By doing this I was able to get unbiased responses that led to both my personas and my storyboard.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="blurb">
        This project was my introduction to UI/UX. It gave me a baseline of understanding how users interact with 
        interfaces and what types of questions need to be considered when designing interfaces.
