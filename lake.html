            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p> 
                This animation explores a recurring vision I have before I sleep. I was interested in capturing movement through this process.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p class="blurb">
            In gearing up for this project, I looked at the work of some artists who use screenprint in their animations. Some of these artists include Julia Schimautz, Dominica Harrison, and Gini Wade. I also drew inspiration from Eadweard Muybridge's <i>The Horse in Motion (1878)</i>.

        </div>
       
        <h2>Design Interations</h2>
        <p class="blurb">
            I knew I wanted to capture motion but went through multiple ideas. I thought about someone riding a bicycle to mimic the movement of the horse, but ultimately, I really wanted to bring my vision to life. The blue of the paper was also an important design choice. The blue is meant to create the environment. Set at night, everything is in a blue hue. I looked at the possibility of other color options but ended up having one edition. One of the biggest questions I posed for myself was "Why screenprint"? I could have carried out the same project with a different medium, but with screenprint, I am really able to capture the variety in prints, paper, and unintentional marks.

            I took videos of myself as reference for the subject's movement throughout the animation.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
       <p class="blurb"> 
        Some of my biggest takeaways from this project is how labor-intensive animation can be. I also learned that there is such a large variety in the style I choose. Finally, I really appreciated the narrative aspect of animation. I like the idea of using art to tell a story. Most art already does this, but with animation, messages can be more clear and more accessible to larger audiences.
